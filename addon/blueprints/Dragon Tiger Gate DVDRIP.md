At the academy, they learn that Master Wong has gone into seclusion to practice a secret technique that can counter the Yijin Jing. They also meet Ma Xiaoling, who is Dragon's love interest and a friend of Tiger. She tells them that her father is dying and that he wishes to see Dragon one last time. Dragon is unable to go as he needs to recover from his injuries. Tiger volunteers to go in his place and bids farewell to Turbo and Dragon.
 
Tiger arrives at Ma Kun's mansion and sees him on his deathbed. He gives Tiger his blessings and tells him to take good care of Dragon and Xiaoling. He also reveals that he was once a student of Dragon Tiger Gate and that he was corrupted by Shibumi. He regrets his actions and hopes that Tiger can stop Shibumi from spreading evil. He then dies peacefully.
 
Meanwhile, Shibumi learns that Ma Kun is dead and that Tiger has the plaque. He sends Lousha and his other fighters to storm the mansion and retrieve the plaque. Tiger fights valiantly but is outnumbered and overpowered by Lousha's Yijin Jing. He is about to be killed when Dragon arrives with Turbo and Xiaoling. They join forces with Tiger and manage to fend off the attackers.
 
They then decide to take the fight to Shibumi and infiltrate his headquarters at Luocha Gate. There, they face many dangers and enemies, including a giant crocodile, a horde of zombies, and a deadly maze. They eventually reach Shibumi's throne room, where he awaits them with the plaque.
