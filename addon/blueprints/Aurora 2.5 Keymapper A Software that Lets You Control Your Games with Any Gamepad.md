Custom hills are one of the most exciting features of Deluxe Ski Jump 4. They are hills created by other players using the DSJ4 Hill Editor, which is a separate program that you can download from [Mediamond - DSJ4 Downloads](https://www.mediamond.fi/dsj4/downloads/). With the hill editor, you can design your own hills from scratch or modify existing ones. You can adjust the shape, size, profile, and texture of the hill, as well as the weather conditions and the audience. You can also add buildings, trees, and other objects to make your hill more realistic and unique.
 
Once you have created your hill, you can upload it to [DSJ4 Hills Database](https://www.mediamond.fi/dsj4/hills/), where other players can download it and rate it. You can also browse and download thousands of custom hills made by other players from around the world. Some of these hills are ranked, which means they have CPU player data and online game support. You can compete on these hills in online tournaments and try to beat the global hill records. You can also compare your personal hill records with other players and see your ranking on each hill.
 
Custom hills add a lot of variety and challenge to Deluxe Ski Jump 4. You can find hills of different sizes, shapes, and difficulty levels. You can also find hills inspired by real ski jumping venues or fictional ones. Some hills are realistic and detailed, while others are creative and fun. You can even find hills based on famous landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty. There is something for everyone in the custom hills community.
