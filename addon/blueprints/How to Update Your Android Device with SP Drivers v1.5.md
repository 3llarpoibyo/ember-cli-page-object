Usually, when you plug in your Galaxy device to your PC, Windows will automatically detect it and install the appropriate drivers for it. However, sometimes Windows may fail to recognize your device or show an error message. In that case, you need to download the correct USB drivers for your Galaxy device from the official Samsung website and manually install them on your PC.
