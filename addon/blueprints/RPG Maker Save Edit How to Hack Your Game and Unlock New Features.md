RPG Maker is a popular game engine that allows anyone to create their own role-playing games. However, sometimes you may want to modify your save files to change some aspects of the game, such as your stats, items, gold, etc. In this article, we will show you how to edit RPG Maker save files using different tools and methods.
 
## Online Save Editor
 
One of the easiest ways to edit RPG Maker save files is to use an online save editor. This is a website that can read and write various types of save files from different versions of RPG Maker. You can access it here: [https://www.saveeditonline.com/](https://www.saveeditonline.com/)

To use the online save editor, you need to upload your save file to the website. You can find your save file in the game folder, usually named something like "Save01.rvdata2" or "Save01.rpgsave". The website will then show you a list of variables that you can edit, such as gold, items, stats, etc. You can change the values as you wish and then download the modified save file. You can then replace your original save file with the edited one and load it in the game.
 
## Local Save Editor
 
If you prefer to edit your save files offline, you can use a local save editor. This is a program that you can download and run on your computer. One example of a local save editor is RMSE (RPGMaker Save Editor). You can find it here: [https://github.com/nathan-b/rmse](https://github.com/nathan-b/rmse)
 
To use RMSE, you need to install Node.js and Electron on your computer. You can then clone or download the RMSE repository from GitHub and run it using npm . RMSE will open a graphical user interface that allows you to browse and edit your save files. You can select your save file from the file menu and then modify the variables as you like. You can then save your changes and overwrite your original save file.
 
## Hex Editor
 
If you want more control over your save files, you can use a hex editor. This is a program that allows you to view and edit any file in hexadecimal format. Hexadecimal is a base-16 number system that uses 16 symbols (0-9 and A-F) to represent each byte of data. By using a hex editor, you can directly manipulate the binary data of your save files.
 
To use a hex editor, you need to open your save file with it. You will see a grid of hexadecimal numbers that represent the bytes of your file. You can then search for the values that you want to change using the find function of the hex editor. For example, if you want to change your gold amount, you can search for the hexadecimal value that corresponds to your current gold amount. You can then replace it with a different hexadecimal value that corresponds to your desired gold amount. You can then save your changes and overwrite your original save file.
