## A Gripping Storyline
`  `
Sultan is not just a typical sports drama. It is also a tale of love, loss, redemption, and self-discovery. Sultan Ali Khan (Salman Khan) is a former wrestling champion who falls in love with Aarfa (Anushka Sharma), a female wrestler and the daughter of his coach. They get married and have a happy life until tragedy strikes and Sultan loses his son in an accident. Devastated by grief, Sultan quits wrestling and drifts away from Aarfa, who also blames him for their son's death.
`  `
Years later, Sultan is approached by Aakash Oberoi (Amit Sadh), the founder of a private mixed martial arts league, who offers him a chance to revive his career and earn money for his village's blood bank. Sultan agrees to join the league and trains under Fateh Singh (Randeep Hooda), a former MMA fighter. He faces many challenges and opponents in the ring, including Tyron Woodley, Ron Smoorenburg, and Brahim Chab. He also hopes to win back Aarfa's love and respect by proving himself as a fighter and a father.
`  `
## A Stellar Cast
`  `
Sultan boasts of an impressive cast of actors who deliver powerful performances. Salman Khan is convincing as the titular character, showing his range of emotions and physical prowess. He undergoes a remarkable transformation from a young and fit wrestler to an older and overweight man, and then back to a lean and mean fighter. Anushka Sharma is equally impressive as Aarfa, portraying her strength, passion, and vulnerability. She also does her own stunts and wrestling moves in the film.
`  `
The supporting cast is also commendable, especially Randeep Hooda as Fateh Singh, who mentors Sultan and becomes his friend. Amit Sadh as Aakash Oberoi is also noteworthy as the ambitious and conflicted promoter of the league. The film also features some real-life MMA fighters such as Tyron Woodley, Ron Smoorenburg, and Brahim Chab, who add authenticity and excitement to the fight scenes.
`  `
## A Spectacular Soundtrack
`  `
Sultan has a catchy and memorable soundtrack composed by Vishal-Shekhar, with lyrics by Irshad Kamil. The songs range from romantic to motivational, reflecting the mood and theme of the film. Some of the popular songs include "Jag Ghoomeya", "Baby Ko Bass Pasand Hai", "Sultan", "Bulleya", and "Tuk Tuk". The songs are sung by talented singers such as Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Vishal Dadlani, Neha Bhasin, Sukhwinder Singh, Shalmali Kholgade, Badshah, Nooran Sisters, Mika Singh, Shekhar Ravjiani, Papon, Mohit Chauhan, Harshdeep Kaur, and Salman Khan himself.
`  `
The background score by Julius Packiam is also effective in enhancing the drama and emotion of the film. The music complements the visuals and creates an immersive experience for the viewers.
