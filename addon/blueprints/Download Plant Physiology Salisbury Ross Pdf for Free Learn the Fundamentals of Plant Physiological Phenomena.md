Plant physiology is the study of how plants function, grow, and interact with their environment. It covers topics such as water and mineral uptake, photosynthesis, respiration, hormone regulation, development, stress responses, and more. Plant physiology is essential for understanding the diversity and importance of plants in nature and agriculture.
