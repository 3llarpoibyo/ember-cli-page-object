### Unlock by IMEI
 
Unlocking by IMEI is the easiest and fastest method to unlock your phone with Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0. IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity, a unique number that identifies your phone. To unlock by IMEI, you just need to enter your IMEI number in the Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0 interface and click on the "Unlock" button.
 
You can find your IMEI number by dialing \*#06# on your phone or by checking the label under the battery or on the box of your phone.
 
After you enter your IMEI number and click on the "Unlock" button, Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0 will connect to the Fastgsm server and generate an unlock code for your phone. This process may take a few minutes depending on your internet connection speed and the availability of the server.
 
Once the unlock code is generated, Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0 will display it on the screen and also send it to your email address that you registered with Fastgsm.
 
To complete the unlocking process, you need to insert a SIM card from a different network or carrier than the one your phone is locked to and turn on your phone. Your phone will ask for an unlock code or a network unlock PIN. Enter the code that Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0 provided you and confirm it.
 
Your phone should be unlocked now and ready to use with any network or carrier of your choice.
 
### Unlock by Cable
 
Unlocking by cable is another method to unlock your phone with Fastgsm Dbx Client 2.3.0. This method is more suitable for phones that do not support unlocking by IMEI or for phones that have a hard lock or a counter lock.
