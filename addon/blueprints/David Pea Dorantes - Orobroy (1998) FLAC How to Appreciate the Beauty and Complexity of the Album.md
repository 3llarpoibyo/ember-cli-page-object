Orobroy is the debut album of Spanish pianist and composer David Pea Dorantes, released in 1998. It is a groundbreaking work that fuses flamenco with jazz, classical and world music influences, creating a unique and original sound that showcases Dorantes' virtuosity and creativity.
 
The album features ten tracks, all composed by Dorantes, that explore different aspects of flamenco culture, such as the cante jondo (deep song), the bulerÃ­a (fast rhythmic dance), the soleÃ¡ (solemn song), the tango (lively dance) and the rondeÃ±a (folk song from Ronda). The title track, Orobroy, meaning "thought" in the CalÃ³ language of the Gypsies, is a stunning solo piano piece that expresses Dorantes' personal vision of flamenco.
