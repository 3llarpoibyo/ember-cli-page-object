The default setting is Full Security, which ensures that your Mac always starts up from a trusted operating system. If you want to install Windows on your Mac using Boot Camp, you need to keep the Secure Boot setting as Full Security. Otherwise, you might encounter errors or problems during the installation process. After you successfully install Windows, you can change the Secure Boot setting to any of the other options if you wish. However, changing the Secure Boot setting will not affect your ability to boot into Windows or Mac OS.

To check your Secure Boot setting, you need to restart your Mac and hold the power button until you see the startup options window. Then, click Options and enter your administrator password. Next, click Startup Security Utility in the Utilities menu. You will see your current Secure Boot setting and the options to change it.
  
The advantages of using Full Security or Medium Security are that they provide more protection for your Mac against malicious software or unauthorized modifications. The disadvantage is that they might prevent some third-party software or devices from working properly with your Mac. The advantage of using No Security is that it allows more compatibility and flexibility for your Mac. The disadvantage is that it exposes your Mac to more potential risks and threats.
  
Before you change your Secure Boot setting, you should make sure that you have a backup of your data and that you understand the consequences of your choice. Changing the Secure Boot setting might require you to reinstall your operating system or erase your disk. You should also consult the documentation or support of any software or device that you use with your Mac to see if they are compatible with Secure Boot.

After you install Windows on your Mac using Boot Camp, you can switch between Windows and Mac OS by restarting your Mac and holding the Option key until you see the startup disk selection screen. Then, you can choose which operating system you want to use. You can also set a default startup disk in the Startup Disk preferences on Mac OS or the Boot Camp Control Panel on Windows.
  
When you use Windows on your Mac, you can access some of the features and functions of your Mac hardware, such as the Touch Bar, the keyboard backlight, the camera, the microphone, and the speakers. However, some of the Mac-specific features and settings might not be available or work differently on Windows. For example, you might not be able to use certain keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, or function keys. You can find more information about using Windows on your Mac in the Boot Camp Support website or the Boot Camp Help app on Windows.
