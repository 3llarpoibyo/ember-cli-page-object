# How to Use Kepler VBIOS Tuner to Boost Your NVIDIA Graphics Card Performance
 
If you have an NVIDIA graphics card based on the Kepler architecture, such as the GeForce GTX 600 or 700 series, you might be interested in tweaking its BIOS settings to improve its performance and efficiency. One of the tools that can help you do that is Kepler VBIOS Tuner, a software developed by Svet, a well-known member and administrator of the MSI Global English Forum.

Kepler VBIOS Tuner lets you modify the VBIOS (Video BIOS) of your NVIDIA Kepler-based graphics card, which is the firmware that controls its basic functions and parameters. You can adjust things like clocks, voltages, boost limits, fan speeds, power limit and more. By doing so, you can overclock your graphics card, optimize its power consumption, reduce its noise level or customize its behavior according to your preferences.
 
However, modifying the VBIOS of your graphics card is not a trivial task and it involves some risks. If you do it wrong, you might damage your graphics card or make it unstable. Therefore, you should always make a backup of your original VBIOS before you start messing with it. You should also be careful not to exceed the safe limits of your graphics card and monitor its temperature and voltage during testing.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Kepler VBIOS Tuner to tweak your NVIDIA graphics card settings. We will assume that you have already downloaded and installed the software from [this link](https://forum-en.msi.com/index.php?threads/svets-fermi-kepler-vbios-ec-fw-tuner-ver-3-26u.148273/). We will also assume that you have some basic knowledge of overclocking and VBIOS editing. If not, we recommend that you read some tutorials or guides before proceeding.
 
## Step 1: Backup Your Original VBIOS
 
The first thing you need to do is to backup your original VBIOS file, in case something goes wrong or you want to restore it later. You can do this with GPU-Z, a free utility that shows detailed information about your graphics card. You can download it from [this link](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/).
 
After you run GPU-Z, click on the small icon next to the BIOS Version field and select "Save to file". Choose a name and a location for your VBIOS file and click "Save". You should see a message saying "BIOS reading not supported on this device" followed by "BIOS was successfully saved". This means that your VBIOS file was saved successfully.
 
## Step 2: Load Your VBIOS File into Kepler VBIOS Tuner
 
Now that you have your original VBIOS file, you can load it into Kepler VBIOS Tuner and start modifying it. Run Kepler VBIOS Tuner as an administrator and click on "Load File" at the top left corner. Browse to the location where you saved your VBIOS file and select it. You should see a message saying "File loaded successfully".

After loading your VBIOS file, you can click on "VBIOS-Z Report" at the top right corner to check and verify its current parameters. It will show you things like GPU core clock, memory clock, voltage table, fan speed table, power limit table and more. You can also see if your VBIOS file is healthy or not by looking at the status column.
 
## Step 3: Modify Your VBIOS Settings
 
Now comes the fun part: modifying your VBIOS settings to boost your graphics card performance. Kepler VBIOS Tuner offers several options for tweaking different aspects of your graphics card. Here are some of them:
 
- **Core Tune:** This option lets you change the GPU core clock speed of your graphics card. You can enter a new value in MHz or use the slider to adjust it. The software will automatically calculate the necessary changes in the voltage table and boost limit table.
- **Memory Tune:** This option lets you change the memory clock speed of your graphics card. You can enter a new value in MHz or 8cf37b1e13
