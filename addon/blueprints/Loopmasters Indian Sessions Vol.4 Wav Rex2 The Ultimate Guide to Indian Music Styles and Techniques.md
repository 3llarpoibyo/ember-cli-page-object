Loopmasters Indian Sessions Vol.4 Wav Rex2 is a great addition to any producer's library who wants to add some exotic and organic percussion sounds to their tracks. The quality and variety of the loops are impressive and the performance by KV Bala Krishnan is flawless. You can listen to some demos and purchase the pack from Loopmasters website[^1^] or from SoundCloud[^2^] [^3^].
  
One of the highlights of the pack is the variety of Tabla loops, which are the most widely used percussion instrument in Indian music. The Tabla consists of two drums, the smaller one called Dayan and the larger one called Bayan. The loops cover different styles and rhythms, such as Teental, Jhaptaal, Rupak, Dadra and Keherwa. You can mix and match the loops to create complex and dynamic patterns.
 
Another interesting instrument in the pack is the Urumi, which is a long double-headed drum with a flexible body that can be bent and twisted. The Urumi produces a low and resonant sound that can add depth and texture to your tracks. The loops are played with sticks or hands and have a tribal and hypnotic feel.
 
The pack also includes some ensemble loops that feature multiple percussion instruments playing together in harmony. These loops are great for creating instant grooves and atmospheres that can fill up your mix. You can also layer them with other loops or sounds to create rich and diverse sonic landscapes.
  
Another instrument that stands out in the pack is the Tavil, which is a barrel-shaped drum with two heads that are played with sticks and fingers. The Tavil is often used in temple music and folk music and has a loud and sharp sound. The loops are energetic and lively and can add some punch and excitement to your tracks.
 
The pack also features some rare and exotic instruments, such as the Singari, which is a small clay pot with a membrane stretched over its mouth. The Singari produces a high-pitched and nasal sound that can create some interesting effects and contrasts. The loops are playful and quirky and can add some spice and humor to your tracks.
