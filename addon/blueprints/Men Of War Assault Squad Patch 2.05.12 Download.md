## What are the Features of Men of War: Assault Squad?
 
Men of War: Assault Squad is a real-time tactics game that offers a variety of features for fans of World War II battles. Some of the main features are:

- A cooperative skirmish game mode that allows players to team up with their friends or other online players and fight against AI enemies on 15 different maps. Each map has its own objectives and challenges, such as capturing strategic points, defending a bridge or destroying a train. The game mode supports up to 16 players in total.
- Five different nations to choose from: Russia, Germany, USA, Commonwealth and Japan. Each nation has its own unique units, vehicles and abilities that reflect their historical strengths and weaknesses. For example, Japan has access to kamikaze units and banzai charges, while Commonwealth has commandos and snipers.
- A direct control feature that enables players to take command of any unit using the WASD keys, rather than pointing and clicking. This allows for more precise and realistic control of the units, as well as more immersion and fun.
- A realistic damage system that takes into account the type and caliber of the weapon, the angle and distance of the shot, the armor and condition of the target and the environment. Units can lose limbs, bleed, catch fire, explode or be crushed by debris. Vehicles can have their tracks, wheels, turrets, engines or weapons damaged or destroyed.
- A dynamic weather system that affects the visibility, accuracy and mobility of the units. Rain, snow, fog and night can create different tactical situations and opportunities.
- A modding support that allows players to create their own maps, missions, units, vehicles and skins using the game's editor and tools.
