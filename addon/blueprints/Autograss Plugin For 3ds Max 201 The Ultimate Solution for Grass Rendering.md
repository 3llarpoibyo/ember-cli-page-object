## Step 1: Install Autograss
 
To install Autograss, you need to download the plugin from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. Make sure you choose the correct version for your 3ds Max and V-Ray. After downloading, run the installer and follow the instructions. You may need to restart 3ds Max after installation.
 
## Step 2: Create an object for the grass
 
To use Autograss, you need to have an object that will serve as the base for the grass. This can be any mesh, such as a plane, a terrain, or a spline. You can also use modifiers to edit the shape of the object. For example, you can use Noise modifier to create some variation in the height of the object.
 
## Step 3: Apply Autograss
 
To apply Autograss, select the object and go to Create panel > Geometry > Happy Digital > Autograss. Click and drag in the viewport to create an Autograss object. You will see a green box around the object, indicating that Autograss is applied. You can adjust the size and position of the box by using the Move and Scale tools.
 
## Step 4: Choose a grass type
 
Autograss comes with eleven preset grass types that cover the most common grasses. You can choose a grass type by clicking on the drop-down menu in the Modify panel > Parameters > Grass Type. You will see a preview of the grass in the viewport. You can also change the color of the grass by using the Color Picker.
 
## Step 5: Adjust the grass settings
 
Autograss has many settings that allow you to customize the appearance and performance of the grass. You can access these settings in the Modify panel > Parameters. Some of the most important settings are:
 
- Density: This controls how many blades of grass are generated per square meter. Higher values result in thicker and more realistic grass, but also increase render time and memory usage.
- Length: This controls how long each blade of grass is. Higher values result in taller and more wild-looking grass, but also increase render time and memory usage.
- Variation: This controls how much variation there is in the length, width, bend, and twist of each blade of grass. Higher values result in more natural and diverse-looking grass, but also increase render time and memory usage.
- Cutoff: This controls how much of the base object is covered by grass. Higher values result in more grass covering more area, but also increase render time and memory usage.
- Thatch: This controls how much dead or dry grass is mixed with the green grass. Higher values result in more realistic-looking grass, but also increase render time and memory usage.
- Direction: This controls how much each blade of grass is aligned with the normal of the base object. Higher values result in more upright and uniform-looking grass, while lower values result in more random and chaotic-looking grass.

## Step 6: Render your scene
 
To render your scene with Autograss, you need to use V-Ray as your renderer. Autograss works with all of V-Ray's features, such as shadows, reflections, depth of field, global illumination, etc. You can adjust your render settings as usual in the Render Setup dialog. When you render your scene, you will see photorealistic grass in your image.
